### Agenda

 1. R system view, workspace, console and basic operations 
 2. R atomic objects --> single values with simplest, most basic format 
 3. Basic operators 
 4. Vectors --> atomic objects extended
 5. Useful functions by class of object
 6. Vectorization + recycling
 7. Subsetting vectors (the [] operator)
 8. Coercion, force an object to belong to a class 
 9. Missing values and reserved words
 10. Matrices --> vectors with a dimension attribute
 11. Factors, positive integer sequences with labels
 12. Data frames --> list of vectors of same length but not necessarily same class  




### Notes

* Everything to the right of the pound symbol is ignored by R (i.e. it's a comment)
* R is case sensitive!
* Press CTRL+Enter to run programs on RStudio
* To pull up documentation for a function run help(namefunction) or ?namefunction
* Rremember that in R you cannot use back slash (\) to indicate paths
