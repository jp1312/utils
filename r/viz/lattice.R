#### LATTICE

# lattice plots are constructed with a single function call to one of the core lattice functions, like xyplot. 
# Aspects like margins and spacings and labels are automatically handled
# lattice system is really ideal when you have data sets that you can look at by conditioning on certain variables
# Panel functions can be customized to modify what is plotted ine ach of the plot panels
